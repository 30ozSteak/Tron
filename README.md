# Game Time Starter Kit (FE - Module 2)

# Tron (Dancing With Myself)

## Goals 
Use OOP to drive the design of an HTML5 Canvas game. 
Be able to pull this off on my own, in... dramatically less time than originally hoped.

A personal goal of mine was to not spend any time on styling this game and just focus on the functionality, so I could get it done in the ....36 hours remaining until it's due. This goal flew out the window after I realized I couldn't stand staring at the project without some basic styling. Woops. Maybe I'll write a blog post about how I don't have time management.

### V.05 'It's just two snakes, right?'

Mod2 is an exciting one. We spend a lot of time in the terminal and working with objects. Gametime's goal is to satisfy the need for visual feedback and have fun while you're learning OOP. 

'fun' is a misnomer.

This project had a much more robust starter-kit. With the movement/collision detection already written for us. I spent the weekend leading up to this project's due date working on personal projects and honing my portfolio, assuming that Tron would just be a slightly modified snake.  Hooboy.

After finally diving into the code, I noticed that the starter-kit we received had a MUCH different approach to.... well... everything. Resisting urges to delete it and revert back to what I knew, I decided to brace the storm and punch the piniata til it worked.
